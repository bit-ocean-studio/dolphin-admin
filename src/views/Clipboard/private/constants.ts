export const ChineseLyrics = `海底 - 一只榴莲
散落的月光
穿过了云
躲着人群
铺成大海的鳞
海浪打湿白裙
试图推你回去
海浪清洗血迹
妄想温暖你
往海的深处听
谁的哀鸣在指引
灵魂没入寂静
无人将你吵醒

你喜欢海风咸咸的气息
踩着湿湿的沙砾
你说人们的骨灰应该撒进海里
你问我死后会去哪里
有没有人爱你
世界能否不再

总爱对凉薄的人扯著笑脸
岸上人们脸上都挂著无关
人间毫无留恋
一切散为烟

散落的月光
穿过了云
躲着人群
溜进海底
海浪清洗血迹
妄想温暖你
灵魂没入寂静
无人将你吵醒

你喜欢海风咸咸的气息
踩着湿湿的沙砾
你说人们的骨灰应该撒进海里
你问我死后会去哪里
有没有人爱你
世界已然将你抛弃

总爱对凉薄的人扯著笑脸
岸上人们脸上都挂著无关
人间毫无留恋
一切散为烟

来不及来不及
你曾笑着哭泣
来不及来不及
你颤抖的手臂
来不及来不及
无人将你打捞起
来不及来不及
你明明讨厌窒息`

export const EnglishLyrics = `22 - Taylor Swift
It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time

Uh oh!
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's Taylor Swift anyway, ew?)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time

Uh oh! (hey!)
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright (alright)
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh (oh, oh, oh)
22, ooh-ooh
I don't know about you
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey
I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me (you don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh (oh – whoa)
22, ooh-ooh (dancing like)
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you`
